# Tyche - pension calculator designed by women for women üíú
This project came to be during SheCanCode Hackathon in June 2024. Our team decided to create a financial planning tool that women, caregivers and people with non-traditional career path can use to calculate their UK pensions. 

Why? Because one of our teammates tried to calculate her pension and figured out that if you are a single mum that has some student loans, at some point were getting benefits and sometimes worked part time it‚Äôs not an easy feat. She ended up creating her own spread sheet to understand her pension as none of existing calculators were flexible enough. 

We pledged to make free, easy to use and accessible tool to help people from all walks of life to lessen their mental load by providing centralised reliable information about the aspect of financial planning that is often overlooked - their pensions. 

Here we should note that we would not be providing financial advice or education but the tool that can help to calculate what kind of pension you can expect to get based on your current salary, various pension contributions and pensions pods already set up. We are creating a tool to assist with long-term financial planning to people whose life is a bit too complicated for a standard pension calculator.

### Current state of the project üìù
After the Hackathon (yes, we won) we thought about our company mission statement, ironed out our project vision and started on our road map. For the first leg of our journey we decided to create a shared backend for web app and iOS app and start on basic salary and pension calculator with data that user should be able to save to theirs profile. In parallel, we are making sure that our pension calculation are correct and up to date - for that we are seeking help of financial adviser (if you are one and want to help - please drop us a [message](mailto:metistoolsuite@gmail.com)!). 

### Technologies we use ü§ñ
* Cloud Firestorm to store user‚Äôs data;
* Cloud Functions for calculations (so they can happened on the back end);
* SwiftUI for iOS app;
* JavaScript for the web app.

We are currently planning to create web app and iOS app. If you are an Android developer and want to join in - we would love to have you, please drop us a [message](mailto:metistoolsuite@gmail.com).
